Layout practice from "Platzi" course

Basic structure of this web:
- A header with a logo, title, and a button.
- A section with a logo, text, and a table.
- A second section with titles, cards, text, and some icons.
- A third section with a background image and a title.
- A final section with cards, title, text, and a price carousel.
- A footer with an image and text.

Fonts:
font-family: "DM Sans", sans-serif;
font-family: "Inter Tight", sans-serif;

- Name classes with the agile methodology BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) based on components.
- Dividing the entire interface into blocks that can be reused and scaled. This way, a section 
can be separated into multiple small sections and given a name in this order and function.
